A good strategy is to target downtown Des Moines for primary bike renting locations. Here we should expect a solid core rider base. Downtown Des Moines offers a large enough community with businesses and a university near by. We can expect bikes to be utilized for downtown travel between popular locations.

## Two Additional Visualizations
It would be smart to compare business data for both Des Moines and Manhattan. Identifying and comparing the number of businesses will help us forecast expected bike rentals. We could also analyze the number of people living in the downtown area for both cities as well. It's highly likely that the core subscriber base would be comprised of individuals living and working close to the downtown area in both cities.
